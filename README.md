# BREAKOUT
Breakout aka Brick breaker
-A small paddle is controlled by the player and can only move within the bounds of the screen; either left or right.
-Player use keyboard or mouse to control the paddle
-The ball travels across the screen and each collision results in the ball changing its direction based on where it hit;
this applies to the screen bounds, the bricks and the paddle.
-If the ball reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player is either game over or loses a life.
-As soon as a brick touches the ball, it is destroyed.
-The player wins as soon as all bricks are destroyed.
New features of game:
-You will win if your score is higher than the high score.
-You will lose if the life <= 0 or there are bricks set lower than paddle.
-Using keyboard is harder than mouse so you will have more life if you using keyboard.
-The ball will move faster, the life is less and you can get more point with each destroyed brick in harder mode.
-There are 5 types of bricks: Normal brick.
